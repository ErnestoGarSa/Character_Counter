Character Counter

This project is a simple web application that counts the number of characters entered into an input field in real time.

You can type up to 50 characters. Once you reach the limit, the counter will turn red to alert you.

Technologies Used

HTML: To structure the page and input field.
CSS: To style the page and dynamically change the counter color.
JavaScript: To implement the character counting functionality through the DOM (Document Object Model).
Features

Real-time character counting.
Visual warning (red color) when the maximum character limit (50) is reached.
Clean and responsive design.
How It Works

As you type into the input field, JavaScript listens for changes.
The program updates the counter immediately using the DOM.
If the character count reaches 50, the counter text changes color to red.
